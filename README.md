# StudioAccessories

This is a collection of plans and schematics for equipment stands and covers.  All of the items in this repository were designed with specific equipment in mind, but are inteded to be as universal as possible (except things like panel lids which will likely only fit the equipment that it is desiged for).  



DXF files are designed to be used on a laser cutter (tested on a RedSail laser using LightBurn software).
